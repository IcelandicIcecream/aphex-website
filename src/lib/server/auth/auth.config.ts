/**

 * WordPress, Ghost, Strapi, Payload and Dokploy. It assumes you sign up promptly
 * after deploying, because an instance left reachable before that belongs to
 * whoever finds the URL first.
 *
 * Two opt-in ways to close that window, and one way to opt out entirely:
 *
 * - `APHEX_BOOTSTRAP_EMAIL=you@example.com` — only that address is promoted.
 * - `APHEX_BOOTSTRAP_CLAIM_CODE=true` — sign-up also needs a code logged at
 *   startup, which the sign-up form prompts for. Note the claim window closes on
 *   the first sign-up, not on the code being used.
 * - `never()` — no promotion at all; provision the first admin out of band.
 *
 * See the Authentication docs for the trade-offs.
